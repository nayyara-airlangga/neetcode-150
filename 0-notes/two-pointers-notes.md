## Overview

### What is it?

The use of two different pointers (usually to keep track of array or string indices) to solve a problem involving said indices with the benefit of saving time and space.

### When to use it?

Solving problems that involves collections/lists where we need to analyze each element of the collection and compare it to its other elements.

Using the two pointers technique, we can process two elements at once. Common approaches are:

1. Two pointers, each starting from the beginning and the end until they both meet.
2. One pointer moving at a slow pace, while the other pointer moves at twice the speed.

Typically used in string or array problems. Example problems are two sum, reversal, palindromes, etc.
